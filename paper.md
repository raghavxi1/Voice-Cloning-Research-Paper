# Summary

This paper presents a lightweight and user-friendly voice dubbing tool developed using Python 3.9 and the ElevenLabs API. The tool allows users to clone and transform voice recordings into distinct character-based outputs such as “Batman” or “Shizuka.” Key features include stability/similarity tuning, audio preprocessing, and support for multiple platforms via a web-based deployment. The system is designed to explore applications in accessibility, education, and content creation. 

# Statement of need

With the rapid advancement of voice synthesis technologies, there is growing demand for accessible tools that enable creative, high-quality dubbing without requiring deep technical expertise. This tool meets that need by providing a low-latency, browser-accessible interface that simplifies voice transformation using state-of-the-art APIs.

# Acknowledgements

We thank the ElevenLabs team for providing robust and developer-friendly voice synthesis APIs. Special thanks to the open-source community for supporting tools such as `pydub`, `ffmpeg`, and Tiiny.site that made lightweight deployment possible.
